This allows us to check that our analysis is credible and provides assurance to senior leaders that modelling risks are being managed appropriately. However, it is important to ensure not just that our work is QAd, but that it is QAd well. The aim of this document is to provide guidance on how to ensure that the QA being carried out is being done properly in order to provide an accurate picture of the reliability of analysis. Before discussing this, however, it is useful to think about what it means for QA to be bad. 1.1 What does bad QA look like? There are many examples where QA is not up to scratch despite following the QA guidance. Here are a few of these examples: The QA is rushed at the last minute. This could be due to the urgency of the project, or pressure from senior leaders or clients, but this can lead to mistakes in the QA or cutting corners. Always ensure that an appropriate amount of time is allocated for QA. This amount of time will often depend on the scale of the project, and the type of analysis that is done. Parts of the analysis are assumed to be right. Even if results look correct, it is important to properly check the analysis that has been done. Just because something looks right doesnt mean that it is! The QAer doesnt ask any real questions about why things have been done the way they were. If a QAer says everything is perfect and raises no concerns or doesnt ask any questions at all, this may suggest that they havent actually undertaken robust QA. Similarly, if someone says that they understand something very complex the first time around, they probably dont understand it. This may be a case of the work being too complex that they struggle to put into words exactly what they dont understand. It may be worth explaining complex pieces of work a couple of times anyway, to ensure that everything has been properly understood. Asking questions can build understanding, and we encourage all QAers to ask questions (even very simple ones!) Assuming that things are right because the data or the software says so. Always avoid a computer says yes attitude. Just because a computer doesnt pick up on any errors doesnt mean that the analysis is completely free from mistakes! Confusion around what QA is needed and what QA has been done. This will be addressed within this document. An up-to-date QA log should be kept at all times to assist with keeping track of QA that has been done, and help highlight where QA is still required. A QA log template is available on the DfE Quality Assurance page QAers being afraid or nervous about raising concerns. This may be more of a problem when QAing for senior analysts. QA is a vital part of every project, and QAers should be made to feel that they are able to voice concerns whenever they arise. It is important to talk through each of these concerns rather that simply disregarding them.

There are many examples of self QA that you can use: Balance checks. Do percentages add up to 100%? Do totals add up correctly? Sense checks. Do outputs look rights or logical? Example: Suppose your analysis tells you that you have a mean average primary school size of 600 pupils across 20,000 schools. This means that you have 12 million primary pupils. Something has clearly gone wrong! Use your common sense, public data and analysis that other analysts have done to sense check your work. If things dont look right, always investigate further. Spot checks. Do some spot checks of formulae, values and calculations. If your spot checks show some errors, it is worth investigating further as these errors may have been replicated elsewhere in the analysis. Remember, before you ask anyone else to QA your work, you should try to prove yourself wrong. 2.2 Odd, funny or unexpected figures If your analysis gives you answers that are unexpected, investigate them! For example, if the Teacher Supply Model (TSM) estimates that every subject needs more Initial Teaching Training (ITT) places this year apart from English, investigate why this is. Is a trend reversing or running counter to expectation? Are values for this year very different to previous years? It is inevitable that someone senior will ask you about any unexpected results. It is important to understand why your model is giving you such answers, and to put these answers into some context using analysis that has been done previously. If you do not have the answers to these questions prepared, it will give people less faith in you and your work. Doing these checks will lead you to either find an error, or produce a logical answer to explain this oddity to stakeholders. Either way, its a win! Being able to demonstrate that you havent just taken analysis at face value makes you look good and makes your analysis better! Always ask yourself, when looking at results, what questions are your stakeholders likely to ask? Preparing anaswers for these types of questions is a very important skill for an analyst. You can guarantee that seniour stakeholders are most likely to ask about numbers that stick out or look odd 2.3 Finding errors The best way to find errors, outliers or things that have gone wrong is to use charts. Charts enable quick sense checks and any odd results will stick out like a sore thumb. One of the first things a good QAer will often do is produce some charts. How about finding a small problem within a big spreadsheet or extensive code? It is useful to always work backwards to find errors. If something looks wrong, work backwards through your spreadsheet or syntax. Look at recent changes and updates. This will enable you to find the place where an oddity first started to appear, and help you to identify the specific problem or cause. When looking for errors, keep calm and focus on each step of a complex process one piece at a time. If you get flustered or stressed, you will often miss errors, so sometimes it pays to have a drink, take a break or sleep on it. A fresh mind will often be more capable of solving a complex issue.

In this section, we will discuss some top tips that will allow others to QA your work easily. Most of these steps are straightforward, but make a huge difference to a Quality Assurer. It's important that you are a 'nice' person to do QA for!

* Arrange a QA resource early. Leaving it until the last minute may result in you struggling to find someone who has time to allocate to the QA, and you might end up with someone who is less than ideal QAing your work.

* Lay out syntax, calculations and workbooks nicely. Explain what you have done *and why* in each calculation step. This is especially important if the calculations are complex or you have made assumptions that aren't immediately obvious.

* If you have pasted numbers into a workbook, explain *where* they came from. This will be useful both for QAing purposing and when carrying out future updates.

* Make expectations on the QA that you need clear to the QAers. Which bits are those that need the most thorough QA? QA checklists can be very helpful. A checklist of mandatory QA activites is available on the [DfE Quality Assurance page](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/sarpi/g/SitePages/Quality-Assurance.aspx). This covers only the very basics of QA that you will need to carry out. You will need to carry out different, more specific QA checks depending on the type of work that you have done.

* Offer QA assistance to others in return.

**Remember**, don't make things needlessly complex! Nobody likes receiving workbooks that are a nightmare to understand, update or QA. Similarly, nobody likes long, complex formulae or syntax that tries to do 3 or 4 things in one step. These take up more time than necessary to QA and increase the likelihood of producing errors.

Taking a little more time to divide processes into clearly explained baby steps makes things easier to QA in the short term and easier to update in the long team. In other words, the more time we spend on QA, the less time we have to spend on the model in future. Plus, taking these steps to 'declutter' your notebooks can reduce pressure and stress.

Writing a code in a certain way or using a certain figure may seem to be obvious at the time, but might not when you or someone else looks at it in the future. For example, that decision to use a value of 233.467 in a calculation this morning was very sensible, but in six months time you'll have completely forgotten why you did that or where that number came from...
